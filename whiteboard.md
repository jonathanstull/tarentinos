Pizza Parlor
Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.

// user-submitted form with drop-down menus for pizza toppings
// constructor for a pizza including nested objects for toppings
// each topping is an array consisting of a value push from a branch that determines cost the cost based on user input
// the final equation will sum the values in the array using a forEach loop and return the cost of the pizza
